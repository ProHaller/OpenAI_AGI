### Overview
This is the very first application I have ever created in my very recent coding journey. Be kind. 
And now my partner GPT can explain to us what we did:

#### Application Name
OpenAI_AGI

### Description
This Python application is designed as a versatile tool for audio processing and text generation, integrating with OpenAI's APIs. It includes capabilities for audio transcription, text summarization, and generating audio from text. The script is structured to include user interactions, environment variable management, and modular audio processing functions.

### Current Features
- **Environment Variable Management**: Setup and loading of required environment variables.
- **Audio Creation**: Generation of audio from text using OpenAI's TTS (Text-To-Speech) models.
- **Audio Trimming**: Functionality to trim the start of audio files based on silence detection.
- **Audio Transcription**: Using OpenAI's models to transcribe audio files.
- **Text Chunking**: Splitting text into manageable chunks for processing.
- **Punctuation Assistant**: Formatting and punctuating transcribed text.
- **Chat Completion**: A chat interface for handling text inputs and generating structured outputs in JSON format.

### Planned Enhancements
- **Refactoring**: Isolate each function for clarity and maintenance.
- **Menu Creation**: Develop a user-friendly menu for easy navigation and operation.
- **Externalization of Options**: Options like trimming, language, and prompts to be made configurable.
- **Memory Implementation**: A feature to remember options and previous operations.
- **Price Evaluation Tokenizer**: An addition to evaluate the cost of tokenization in operations.
- **CustomTkinter GUI**: Integrate a graphical interface for better user interaction.
- **Repository Creation**: Make the project available on GitHub as a public repository.
- **CLI Application**: Develop and publish the application as a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool on package managers like brew and pip.

### Usage
- Provide detailed instructions on how to run and use the current version of the application.

### Contribution
- Guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards, the process for submitting pull requests, etc.
